# Example of the Wallet Connect Button in a Vue app 

This repo shows an example of the integration of the Wallet Connect Button in a Vue app. It is based on the standard Vue 3 + Vite setup. For further explanation and documentation, visit: https://wallet-connect.eu

In src/App.vue there are two example buttons. The Quick & easy (frontend only) variant and the secure (via backend) variant. If you want to run the secure variant, you need to run a backend. To run the NodeJS backend example, use: 
```
npm run server:node
```

To run the Python backend example, use:
```
npm run server:python
```
